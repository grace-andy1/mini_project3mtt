Project: Number Guessing Game
Objective:
Create a number-guessing game in which the user guesses a randomly generated number within a certain range. The program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Steps:
Generate a Random Number: Use Python’s random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.

User Input: Prompt the user to enter their guess.

Conditional Statements: Use if, elif, and else to compare the user’s guess with the random number.

Loop: Use a while loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they get the correct number.

Feedback: Provide feedback after each guess, telling the user if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
